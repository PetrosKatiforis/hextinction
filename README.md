## Hexctinction Source Code

Hexctinction is a local multiplayer turn-based hex-tiled pixel art strategy game where you are the ruler of a kingdom. The gameplay is a bit complex so here's a simple explanation of how to play:

## How to Play

(Before showing the rules, I just want to make it clear that everything is customizable. The game is structured using constants defined mostly in `` context.h ``)

    - Players are spawned in all map corners and they start with a single capital city. Your goal is to conquer the enemy's capital. (This is inspired by Hex Empires)

    - Soldiers can be trained by right clicking in cities. Knights are for fighting and saboteurs have more moves per turn and can only destroy enemy farms. They are a great fit if you're just planning to damage your enemy's economy

    - You can move in water by exiting from a port. Collecting fish will give you a small amount of coins which is crucial early on in the game

    - You can create a farm by right clicking on a tile of claimed grass. They give you income after each turn. You need to press space to end your turn. The game is meant to be played using only a mouse

## Credits

    - The game music is exclusively composed by Alexandros Katsanos
    
    - All sound effects were downloaded from freesound.org. The pixel art is drawn by me using Libresprite.

    - This game is partly inspired by metasauce's hex-empires and yiotro games' antiyoy but I think I ended up making it original enough. I can describe it as a combination of the two with some additional features on top of them.
